            <h3 class="text-center">Research Question 1</h3> <h4> How will climate change in southern California impact fire behavior and, particularly, extreme fire events?</h4>

                <p><br />
                  ➢	Fire regimes are bimodal in southern California, with approximately 55% of wildfire area burned historically attributed to summer season fires, and 45% attributed to autumn, Santa Ana wind-driven fires. 
                  <br /><br />
                  ➢	The multi-model ensemble mean (an average of 13 GCMs) projects May-August temperatures of 5 degrees warmer than the historical (1970-2000) period, and February-June precipitation at 8% less. While model projections vary widely, there is strong agreement in warmer summers and drier spring and early summer periods. 
                  <br /><br />
                  ➢	Drier spring months are projected to contribute to a significant increase in fire danger, as represented by Energy Release Component (ERC), during the early part of the fire season (April/May). In southern California, an increase in fire danger associated with drying in the early part of fire season promotes an increase in fire activity during a period when activity has historically been low. This was actualized during the 2009 Jesusita Fire in Santa Barbara, which ignited the first week of May and consumed over 8,000 acres and 80 homes. Early drying also facilitates reduced live fuel moisture and increases the potential for large, mid-summer wildfires like the 2007 Zaca Fire.    </p> <br />
                <h5 class="text-center"><p><em>Conclusions:</em> Fuel treatments in southern California forests should be planned for summer fuel-driven fires, not fall Santa Ana wind-driven fires, and a summer climatology window that excludes Santa Ana conditions (e.g., May 15 – Sept 15) should be used to model fire behavior and test treatment effectiveness.</h5>
                  
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h3 class="text-center">Research Question 2</h3> <h4> How well will existing fuel treatments modify future fire behavior so as to aid fire suppression?</h4> 

            
          <p><br />
            ➢	Future fire behavior projected by the middle-of-the-road GCM was less than a 25% increase from modeled fire behavior for the late 20th century, with a mean increase of 5-15%. For example, for the Arrowhead treatment on the San Bernardino National Forest, the mean increase in flame length  was 10%, and 97% of the treatment area saw less than a 16% increase. However, small pockets of fuels were modeled at a 60-70% increase in flame length.
<br /><br />
➢	The worst-case scenario GCM produced similar increases in fire behavior to the middle-of-the-road scenario for 90th percentile conditions. In some cases, there was no difference between changes in fire behavior associated with the two scenarios.
<br /><br />➢	The worst-case scenario GCM produced the greatest increases in fire behavior associated with the 97th percentile conditions, but these increases were primarily seen in flame lengths and burn probability. Fire line intensity and rate of spread did not increase significantly under mid-21st century 97th percentile conditions as compared to 90th percentile conditions.
<br /><br />➢	Results suggest that while some treatments (e.g., Charlton-Chilao) will be effective in modifying fire behavior even under the worst-case scenario future conditions, others (e.g., Ojai CDZ) will not, and will require alternative treatment strategies to be effective.
<br /><br />
➢	We found that the Charlton-Chilao Vegetation Treatment burned under approximately the 90th percentile historic conditions. If the fuel treatment had not been implemented, modeled fire behavior for the untreated landscape indicated that the Station Fire would have been nearly 15% greater in extent, burning an additional 10,000 ha under the observed weather conditions (acquired from the Chilao RAWS).
<br /><br />
➢	There was no significant difference in modeled fire behavior between historic and future middle-of-the-road or worst-case scenario, GCM-derived 97th percentile conditions within the fuel treatment. However, there was a 49% increase in area burned under future, worst-case scenario conditions, associated with significant increases in fire behavior outside of fuel treatments.


          <br /><br /><h5 class="text-center"><p><em>Conclusions:</em> The Charlton-Chilao fuel treatment was effective in modifying the Station Fire behavior and protecting the Chilao Fire Station, but under the projected mid-21st century climate, the treatment would not have modified fire behavior as effectively, resulting in 50% greater area burned.</h5>
          
             <hr class="featurette-divider">
             
			  <h3 class="text-center"> Research Question 3</h3><h4> How can fire managers throughout southern California and nationally use this information to increase cost-effectiveness in their fuels treatment programs? </h4>                       
            <p><br /><br />
              ➢	Managers can utilize newly available global climate model data that has been made available by multiple research entities in a spatial resolution and data format that is more user-friendly and directed at management uses. 
<br /><br />➢	We outline 12 best practices for utilizing and making decision based on climate model projections and the resulting fire behavior model outputs in the Best Practices guide. 
<br /><br />➢	Alternatives that utilize climate model projections can be developed as part of the NEPA planning process, but should be produced with expert guidance from a fire behavior analyst.<br /><br />

              <h5 class="text-center"><p><em>Conclusions:</em> All six of the fuel treatments are projected to experience significant increases in flame length, rate of spread, crown fire and other important fire behavior metrics, and will likely not meet effectiveness objectives by the mid-21st century.</h5>
