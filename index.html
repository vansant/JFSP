        <h3 class="text-center">Motivation</h3>

        <p>One of the key uncertainties in fuels treatments is their longevity
        under a changing climate. Several recent studies have assessed fuel
        treatment effectiveness during historic fires, and in many cases found
        the treatment less effective than desired, particularly during extreme
        conditions. In 2007, southern California experienced one of the most
        severe fire seasons to-date due to record low fuel moistures begining
        early in the fire season (a key driver of the two-month long Zaca fire)
        and persisting throughout October to enable Santa Ana wind driven fires
        late in the season. Climate change projections for the region suggest
        that these extreme conditions may be observed with increasingly greater
        frequency over the next half century. Southern California has one of
        the largest Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) extents in the country, and
        the extent of WUI is projected to increase significantly over the next
        50 years. Fuels treatments are particularly important in mitigating
        wildland fire risk in WUI areas when extreme fire conditions occur.
        However, fuels treatments are traditionally designed to withstand
        historic fire weather conditions (i.e., from FireFamilyPlus), not
        future conditions, which makes their effectiveness less likely in the
        future.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Research Questions</h3>

        <p>1. How will climate change in southern California impact fire
        behavior and, particularly, extreme fire events?<br>
        <br>
        2. How well will <em>existing</em> fuel treatments modify future fire
        behavior so as to aid fire suppression?<br>
        <br>
        3. How can fire managers throughout southern California and nationally
        use this information to increase cost-effectiveness in their fuels
        treatment programs?<br>
        <br></p>
        <hr class="featurette-divider">

        <h3 class="text-center">Methods</h3>

        <p>In order to address uncertainties in the effectiveness of fuel
        treatments under a changing climate, we undertook an analysis of six
        fuel treatments across three southern California national forests. USFS
        fire managers on the Los Padres, Angeles and San Bernardino National
        Forests were integrated into our research by helping to identify six
        critical landscape fuel treatments of concern. Specifically, we 1)
        worked with USFS fire managers on the Los Padres, Angeles and San
        Bernardino National Forests to identify six critical landscape fuel
        treatments of concern, 2) developed downscaled projections of future
        climate and fire weather scenarios for 50 Remote Automated Weather
        Stations (RAWS) in southern California, 3) analyzed historical fire
        data from the region to identify an appropriate climatological testing
        window coincident with seasonality of fires that fuel treatments are
        meant to modify the behavior of, 4) tested the effectiveness of the six
        fuel treatments under future (mid-21st century) extreme fire weather as
        delineated from climate projections, and 5) developed guidelines and
        tools for incorporating future climate and fire weather scenarios into
        fuels treatment development. Additionally, due to the coincidence of
        the 2009 Station Fire burning into one of our six fuel treatment sites
        on the Angeles National Forest, we conducted an additional case study
        assessment of the Charlton-Chilao fuel treatment to assess its
        effectiveness during the Station Fire.</p>
